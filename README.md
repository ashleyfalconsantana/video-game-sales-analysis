# video-game-sales-analysis
A beginner-friendly data analysis project using Excel, Python (Pandas), SQL, and Power BI to explore and visualize video game sales data.

## 1. Project Objective + Business Question
**Objective**: To use historical game data to identify key trends in games sales, where they are being sold the most/least, what platforms sell the most games, etc.

**Business Questions**:
1. How has the video game industry changed over time?
2. Which gaming platforms were the most successful?
3. Which games and genres dominate in America, Europe, and Japan?
4. What publisher consistenly produces top-selling games?

## 2. Methodology + Tools
1. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning was done using Jupyter Notebooks, where I looked for missing and repetitive values. All repeated publisher names were condensed into their main titles for easier analysis, and all null values were replaced with the string 'Unknown' using the fillna() function.
2. **Data Modeling**: Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL Server database for structured analysis.
3. **Analysis**: Used SQL to query the database and answer the business questions.
4. **Visualization + Reporting**: (Future Step) Will use Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for a final deliverable.
